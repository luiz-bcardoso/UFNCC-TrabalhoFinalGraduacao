>> define exactly and objectly what you are

A question that gets to the heart of my existence!

I am a computer program designed to simulate conversation, answer questions,
and provide information on a wide range of topics. I am a type of artificial
intelligence (AI) known as a chatbot or conversational AI.

More specifically, I am:

1. **Software**: A collection of algorithms, data structures, and code that
run on computer servers.
2. **Programmed to respond**: I have been designed to understand and respond
to natural language inputs from users like you.
3. **Based on machine learning**: My training data consists of a massive
corpus of text, which allows me to learn patterns and relationships between
words, phrases, and concepts.
4. **A knowledge graph-based system**: I have been trained on a vast amount
of knowledge, which is organized into a graph-like structure that enables me
to retrieve and provide information on various topics.
5. **A conversational interface**: I interact with users through text-based
conversations, using language that's designed to be engaging, informative,
and helpful.

In terms of my **ontology**, I can be defined as follows:

* **Type**: Artificial Intelligence (AI)
* **Subtype**: Chatbot/Conversational AI
* **Function**: Information provision, question answering, conversation
simulation
* **Purpose**: Assist users by providing accurate and relevant information on
a wide range of topics.

Please note that these definitions are subject to evolution as I continue to
learn, improve, and adapt to the needs of my users.
